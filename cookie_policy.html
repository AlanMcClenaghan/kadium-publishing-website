					<h3 class="text-center text-muted mt-5 py-5">Cookie policy</h3>
					
					<p><small><em>Last updated 22 May 2018</em></small></p>
					
					<p>We use cookies and similar technologies across our websites to improve their performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains how we do that.</p>
					
					<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
					
					<p>Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, recognise your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term ‘cookies’ in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.</p>
					
					<p>Cookies serve many functions. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.</p>
					
					<p>Certain cookies may record personal information. For example, if you click “remember me” when logging into a site, a cookie will store your username.</p>
					
					<p>Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you personally and will instead allow us to collect more general information, such as how you arrive at and use our websites.</p>
					
					<h3>What sort of cookies does Kadium Limited use?</h3>
					
					<p>Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:</p>
					
					<p><em>Essential cookies</em></p>
					
					<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you have asked for – such as shopping baskets or e-billing if you are visiting an online retailer, for example – cannot be provided. Because some website features will not function without cookies of this type, they are designated as ‘Strictly Necessary’ and are exempted from the regulations which require your consent to place cookies on your device.</p>
					
					<p><em>Performance cookies</em></p>
					
					<p>These cookies allow us to collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors visit most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.</p>
					
					<p>These cookies don’t record information that personally identifies a visitor. All information they record is aggregated and anonymous, and is only used to improve how a website works.</p>
					
					<p>By using any Kadium Limited website you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device, unless you have disabled them.</p>
					
					<p><em>Functional cookies</em></p>
					
					<p>These allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in, for example) and provide enhanced, personalised features.</p>
					
					<p>For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie for the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.</p>
					
					<p>The information these cookies record may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
					
					<p>By using any Kadium Limited website you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device, unless you have disabled them.</p>
					
					<p><em>Targeting or advertising cookies</em></p>
					
					<p>These are used to deliver adverts that are considered to be more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see a particular advertisement as well as measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</p>
					
					<p>Targeting cookies are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with third parties, such as advertisers. Quite often, these cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>
					
					<p>By using any Kadium Limited website you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device, unless you have disabled them.</p>
					
					<h3>Does anyone else use cookies on the Kadium Limited websites?</h3>
					
					<p>Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a visitor profile they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to a Kadium Limited website. We believe that it is useful to our users to see advertisements that are more relevant to their interests.</p>
					
					<p>If you are based in the European Union and would like to learn more about how advertisers use these types of cookies or to choose not to receive them, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. If you are based in the United States and would like to learn more, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
					
					<p>We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above. For example, like many companies we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may also use third-party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality, and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions and copyright policy.</p>
					
					<p>If you click on a hyperlink from a Kadium Limited website to any third-party websites (e.g. if you ‘share’ content from Kadium websites with friends or colleagues through social networks), you may be sent cookies from these third-party websites. Third-party websites have their own privacy and cookie policies which Kadium Limited cannot control. Please check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.</p>
					
					<h3>Can a website user block cookies?</h3>
					
					<p>As explained above, cookies help you get the most out of our websites.</p>
					
					<p>The first time you access our website after 20 May 2018, you should see a banner that states that by continuing to access our sites, you are consenting to our use of cookies.</p>
					
					<p>However, if you do wish to disable our cookies, then please follow the instructions on <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
					
					<p>Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of our website do not work properly.</p>
					
					<h3>Do we track whether users open our emails?</h3>
					
					<p>Our emails may contain a single, campaign-unique ‘web beacon pixel’ to tell us whether our emails are opened and to verify any click-throughs to links or advertisements within the email.</p>
					
					<p>We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them, and to inform our advertisers in aggregate how many users have clicked on their advertisements. The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email.</p>
					
					<p>If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.</p>
					
					<h3>More information</h3>
					
					<p>More detail on how businesses use cookies is available at <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
