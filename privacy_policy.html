					<p><small><em>Last updated 22 May 2018</em></small></p>
					
					<h3>Introduction & General Terms</h3>

					<p>This document ("privacy policy"), in combination with the cookies policy and competition rules, make up our commitment to protecting personal information we hold about our customers, prospective customers, newsletter recipients, magazine recipients, competition entrants, website users or any other data subject 	whose personal information we hold.</p> 
					<p>Personal information as outlined in this policy is being processed by Kadium Ltd ("we", "our", "us", "Kadium Limited"). You can find out more about us by visiting <a href="http://www.kadiumpublishing.com/contact.html" target="_blank">kadiumpublishing.com/contact</a>.</p> 
					
					<p>In the event of any part of Kadium Limited either being sold or going into receivership, we reserve the right to continue to share your data with third parties in accordance with the latest preferences you have provided. You will be informed should any change of ownership occur, and the new owner will manage your personal information preferences.</p>

					<h3>Our Commitment To You</h3>

					<p>We are committed to managing and safeguarding your personal information in accordance with current legislation and best practice.</p>

					<p>Our aim is to be responsible, relevant and secure when using your data. Whenever you provide personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this privacy policy. We will process the personal information you have supplied to conduct and manage our business, give you the most appropriate marketing, information, services and products and provide the best and most secure experience. These are what we consider to be our 'legitimate interests'.</p>

					<p>Our aim is to keep your data accurate and secure at all times and to honour your data preferences with regard to receipt of direct marketing, for example, postal communications, email, mobile messaging and telephone calls.</p>

					<p>Kadium Limited operates websites that may contain hyperlinks to sites owned and operated by third parties. These third-party websites have their own privacy policies and are also likely to use cookies. We therefore urge you to review them. They will govern the use of the personal information you submit when visiting their websites, which may also be collected by cookies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third-party websites, and your use of such sites is therefore at your own risk.</p>

					<p>We may use third-party suppliers to provide some of our services to you. In some circumstances, these providers may be based in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) whose laws provide for a different standard of protection for your personal information than that provided under UK law. In such circumstances:</p>

					<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</p>

					<p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</p>

					<p>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the 'Privacy Shield' which requires them to provide 	similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the U.S. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>

					<p>If you would like further information about the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA, please contact the publisher, Kathy Moynihan, at: <a href="mailto:kathym@kadiumpublishing.com">kathym@kadiumpublishing.com</a>.</p>

					<p>Your personal data will not be disclosed to state institutions and authorities except if required by law or other regulation. Before we release data on this basis, we will ensure that the information is being provided to a genuine and properly authorised investigation.</p>

					<p>We reserve the right to revise or amend this privacy policy at any time to reflect changes to our business or changes in the law. Where these changes are significant, we will endeavour to email all our readers and users to make sure that they are informed of such changes. However, it is your responsibility to check this privacy policy before each use of the website.</p>

					<h3>Who We Are</h3>

					<p>Kadium Limited publishes a range of business to business print and digital publications that include email newsletters with supporting websites, all of 	which are governed by this privacy policy. For an up to date list of our publication brands, please visit <a href="http://www.kadiumpublishing.com" target="_blank">kadiumpublishing.com</a>.</p>

					<h3>What Data We Collect</h3>

					<p>When you send us information, talk to us over the phone, submit an online form or visit one of our websites, we may collect both personal and pseudonymous data about you. Personal data means any information that can identify you as an individual, such as your name and postal address. Pseudonymous data does not identify you as a person but it might be used in aggregate, for instance when you participate in a survey or when we analyse audience interaction with our products and services.</p>

					<h3>Data You Provide To Us</h3>

					<p>When you participate in, access, purchase or sign up to any of our services, activities or online content, such as magazine subscriptions, newsletters, 	competitions or events, we receive personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, email address, postal address, landline or mobile number, as well as information collected about your use of our services (such as when you enter our sites and how long you stay on them).</p>

					<h3>Data About Children</h3>

					<p>If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 13 ("child" or "children") and have provided us with information belonging to a child, then alongside the child's data provided we may also process limited personal data about you, so we can record your consent to store, process and use this information about the child to fulfil the service you have purchased or signed up to on their behalf. We may use your contact details to communicate with you about the child's use of these products or services.</p>

					<p>We will never knowingly send marketing communications to a child under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected personal information about your child without your consent, you may contact the publisher, <a href="mailto:kathym@kadiumpublishing.com">kathym@kadiumpublishing.com</a> and request that we remove information about your child.</p>

					<h3>Data We Buy From a Third Party</h3>

					<p>We occasionally purchase data from third-party suppliers which is primarily business data. This data may include, but not be limited to, a business email address, business job title and business postal address.</p>

					<p>Such a purchase may result in you receiving communications from Kadium Limited regarding your business sector or business interests without you having directly supplied your information to us. We keep clear records of the data suppliers and provide an option to 'unsubscribe' at every contact.</p>

					<p>If you have any queries concerning the use of business data we hold about you please contact the publisher, Kathy Moynihan, at: <a href="mailto:kathym@kadiumpublishing.com">kathym@kadiumpublishing.com</a>.</p>

					<h3>Data We Collect Through Your Use Of Our Websites</h3>

					<p>We may collect information about how you use our websites or other content online, and the device(s) you use to access the services. This includes 	collecting unique online identifiers such as IP addresses, which are numbers that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the 	internet. Anonymous data will be recorded for the purpose of reporting web traffic statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our sites.</p>

					<p>We may receive information about you from any third parties we may partner with through the use of cookie technologies to personalise advertisements for goods and services (please see 'Online advertising' below for further information).</p>

					<p>To opt out of receiving advertisements tailored to your interests by our partners, visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>

					<p>For detailed information on cookies we use please see 'Cookies and how we use them' as well as our <a href="http://www.kadiumpublishing.com/cookie_policy.html" target="_blank">cookie policy</a>.</p>

					<p>We use cookies for a number of reasons:</p>

					<p>Strictly Necessary Cookies - these are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the website will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>

					<p>Performance Cookies - these allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our website. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular, and to see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>

					<p>Functional Cookies - these enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.<br>

					<p>Targeting Cookies - these may be set through our website by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>

					<p>Social Media Cookies - these are set by a range of social media services that we have added to our website to enable you to share our content with others in your networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.</p>

					<p>For more information on how we use cookies please read our <a href="http://www.kadiumpublishing.com/cookie_policy.html" target="_blank">cookie policy here</a>.</p>

We do not accept responsibility for content on third-party websites and have no control over it or its creators. Kadium Limited's privacy policy does not apply 	to these companies, sites or content and if such third-party sites collect personal data, we cannot control how this data is processed, stored or used.

					<h3>Using Our Websites From Outside The UK</h3>

					<p>We use servers located in the EEA to store data. When you submit your details from whichever country you are situated in, you agree to the data being transferred to the EEA and processed under the terms of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) including any implementing data protection legislation in the United Kingdom. If you are not in agreement with this legislation, please do not add your personal details on the website.</p>

					<h3>How We Keep Your Personal Data Secure</h3>

					<p>Kadium Limited's security policies, rules and technical measures have been implemented to protect your personal information from unauthorised or improper use and from accidental loss.</p>

					<p>All our employees and data processors that have access to, and are associated with, the processing of your personal information are legally obliged to respect the confidentiality of your data and are bound by contract to do so.</p>

					<p>The Magazine Printing Company; FloStream; Larva Technologies; Castle Graphics; CJ Leech & Co; Stevens & George Print Group</p>

					<p>We may also have to share your personal data with third parties whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.

					<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems only for as long as required to provide you with the products and/or services you have requested.</p>

					<p>To unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing email and update your account preferences. You may also contact us to inform us if you do not wish to receive any marketing materials from us.</p>

					<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see 'Your rights' below for further information.  In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

					<h3>Personal Data - Your Rights</h3>

					<p>Under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), including any implementing data protection legislation in the UK, you have the following rights:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Your right to be informed</li>

						<li>Your right to erasure</li>
						<li>Your right to restrict processing</li>
						<li>Your right to data portability</li>
						<li>Your right to object</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Your rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</p>

					<h3>Rights To Be Informed</h3>

					<h3>Rights To Access</h3>	

					<p>You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (this right has also been described as a 'subject access request'). Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully.</p>

					<p>It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data.</p>

					<p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out below and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>

					<h3>Your Right To Rectification & Erasure</h3>

					<p>You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate.</p>

					<p>You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (the 'right to be forgotten').</p>

					<p>Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is correct.</p>

					<p>Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal grounds to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.</p>

					<p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out below and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request.</p>

					<p>If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>

					<h3>Your Right To Restrict Processing</h3>

					<p>Where we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the 'How we use your data' section of this policy) you are entitled to ask us to stop processing if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.</p>

					<p>You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data:</p>

					<ol type="a">
						<li>If you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us to verify that data's accuracy.</li>
						<li>Where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
						<li>Where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.</p>

					<p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details below and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>

					<h3>Your Right To Portability</h3>

					<p>Where you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.</p>

					<p>Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.</p>

					<h3>Your Right To Stop Receiving Communications</h3>

					<p>For details on your rights to ask us to stop sending you various kinds of communications, please email the publisher, Kathy Moynihan, at <a href="mailto:kathym@kadiumpublishing.com">kathym@kadiumpublishing.com</a></p>

					<h3>Your Right To Object To Automated Decision Making & Profiling</h3>

					<p>You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision-making and profiling of your personal data and, where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.</p>

					<h3>Exercising Your Rights</h3>
